# 12V RGB LED Strip Driver

12V driven by power MOSFETs, controlled by three 3V3-5V GPIOs.

To be powered by a 12VDC/5A power supply, enough to drive 300 diodes,
typically 5M in length. Includes a 5V voltage regulator for the MCU
board.

At 75MM x 25MM, the board comes with enough space for a vertically
placed Waveshare ESP32-S3-Zero, but can be controlled via three GPIOs
from any source.
